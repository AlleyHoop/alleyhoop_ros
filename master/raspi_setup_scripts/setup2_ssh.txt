After installing ubuntu mate 16.04 on the sd card (with or without script)
1. attach a keyboard, mouse and screen
2. power the PI
3. ubuntu mate will ask for setup, follow the setup. 
        a. set the name to 'alleyhoop'
        b. set the full name to 'alleyhoop-master'
        c. set the user name to 'alleyhoop'
        d. set the password to 'raspberry'
        e. enable auto login
4. finish the ubuntu setup
5. setup a static ethernet connection by clicking on the right top -> edit connections
        a. add a new ethernet connection
        b. set the ip to 192.168.200.100
        c. set the mask to 255.255.255.0
        d. set the gateway to 192.168.200.1
        e. set the nameservers to 8.8.8.8
6. connect an ethernet cable between PC and PI
7. enable network sharing in wifi properties on PC to share internet with ethernet
8. setup PC ethernet port to 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.200.1
        a. reboot PC if first time using the shared wifi settings
9. you can now connect to the pi using ssh (so you can move your pi to only work from ssh)
        a. ssh alleyhoop@192.168.200.100
10. update the system with the following commands:
        a. sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y git wget ifmetric
11. setup the network interface for wifi connection in file /etc/network/interfaces as configured in the file config_files/interfaces
12. start a hotspot using a tool like mhotspot with the following configurations
        a. ssid :  alleyhoop-hotspot
        b. password : alleyhoop-1337
13. edit the ethernet on your pc to a static IP since its probably changed because the hotspot overwrites shared connections. This time around ensure that the ethernet is set statically as step 5
14. ssh into the PI using ssh alleyhoop@192.168.200.100
15.
